Setup

Place Countdown.dll in smartie plugin directory.  Use $dll(Countdown.dll,1,date,message) in LCD Smartie.  The date can be for example 12/25/2005.
The year must be writen with four digits not 05.  A working example would be $dll(Countdown.dll,1,12/25/2005,Merry Christmas Everyone!).
This plugin will show days, hours, minutes, and seconds til date.  Once the time has been reached, the message will be displayed in its place.
Like Merry Christmas Everyone! in the example given.  If you find a problem please email.
