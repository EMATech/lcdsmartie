hotkey.dll - hotkey plugin for LCD Smartie

V0.1 (2005-07-13)



# introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin implements "global" (*1) hotkeys for LCD Smartie. It is intended
to be used with the "Actions" feature of LCD Smartie to trigger actions.

(*1) "global" as in "system-wide" or "focus-independent"



# installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy the files "hotkey.dll" and "hotkey.ini" into the "plugins" folder of
LCD Smartie.



# configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two steps have to be done:
1. define key codes (hotkey.ini)
2. define actions (LCD Smartie Setup - Actions tab)

Detailed description of the two steps follows:

1. define key codes (hotkey.ini)
--------------------------------
This step is optional.
If the file "hotkey.ini" is not present in the "plugins" folder or if the
original file from the distribution is used then these 3 keys are active:
   default hotkeys
   key #1 - Ctrl-F10
   key #2 - Ctrl-F11
   key #3 - Ctrl-F12
You can edit the file "hotkey.ini" to define up to 19 hotkeys. Please read
the comments in that file for the details.

2. define actions (LCD Smartie Setup - Actions tab)
---------------------------------------------------
Open the setup window of LCD Smartie and go to the Actions tab. Add a new
line for each hotkey you want to use:

   (If)  $dll(hotkey,[key number],,)  >  0  (Then)  [action]

[key number] is the number of the key in the "hotkey.ini" file
[action] is the action to be performed

For instance, the action
   (If)  $dll(hotkey,1,,)  >  0  (Then)  NextScreen
will switch to the next screen if hotkey #1 is pressed.



# technical details
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions 1 to 19 are used to poll the state of the respective hotkeys.
They return "1" if the hotkey was pressed, otherwise they return "0". If "1"
is returned then the internal counter for that hotkey is decremented, so that
each key press is reported only once.

Normal usage for actions (as described above) doesn't require any parameters.
However, if the values "about" and "function" are given as param1 and param2
then the functions return a text description like this:
$dll(hotkey,1,about,function)   returns
[hotkey.function1 (hotkey: mod=2,key=79) returns "1" if key was pressed,
 otherwise "0"]

Function 20 is not associated with a hotkey. It returns plugin version info.

Function SmartieInit initializes the hotkeys:
-open an invisible window (uses MFC because I know how to handle that)
-read key codes from ini-file, if that fails use default key codes
-register global hotkeys in Windows (as messages for the invisible window)

Function SmartieFini removes the hotkeys:
-unregister global hotkeys
-close the invisible window

Please note that the full source code (Visual C++ 6.0) is included.
