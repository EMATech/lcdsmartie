The Demo.dll shipped with the LCD smartie program has some useful functions you can use...
Try to play with it its great. Special with math functions that smartie doesn't support in current version.
usage is
$dll(demo.dll,5,param1,param2) where "demo.dll" is the filename, 5 is the number of function you want to call, param1 is the first parameter and param2 is the second parameter you send to dll.


A list with function discovered follows:

1=add
example: $dll(demo.dll,1,44,192)
result:=236

2=subtrack
example: $dll(demo.dll,2,44,192)
result:=-148

3=multiply
example: $dll(demo.dll,3,44,192)
result:=8448

4=divide
example: $dll(demo.dll,4,44,192)
result:=0.23

5=display as par1par2
example: $dll(demo.dll,5,44,192)
result:=19244

6=diplay time
example: $dll(demo.dll,6,44,192)
result:=2:07:32 pm

7=display credits screen
example: $dll(demo.dll,7,44,192)
result:=BasieP Ruled

8=display non character text
example: $dll(demo.dll,8,LCD SMARTie,192)
result:=|CD 5|\/|4R7i3


Function 9:
9 is for converting the output from $bar so that _ and the full block can be changed to other characters (such as custom defined characters...)

Usage is: $dll(demo,9,[string],[char1][char2])
example: $dll(demo,9,$Bar($CPUUsage%,100,10),AB)
This would cause a bar graph to be displayed but instead of _ a B will appear, and instead of a full block a A will appear. This can be used with other commands than $Bar.

Function 10:
10 seems to be doing ( parameter1 * 1.8 ) + 32 - So may be good for converting from degrees Celcius to degrees Fahrenheit.
