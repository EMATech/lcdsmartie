Introduction 
This is a plugin that makes it possible to display the percentage 
(line "xx % Writing to") while Nero is burning a disk. 

Install: 

1. Put mem.dll into plugins dir 
2. Change e.g. screen (14) to theme (2) 
3. Put the following line into screen (14): 
"$dll(mem,1,0,0)" 
4. Make 2 "Actions": 
a) $dll(mem,1,0,0) <> none then GoToTheme(2) 
b) $dll(mem,1,0,0) = none then GoToTheme(1) 

While the Nero is working, it displays the line "xx % Writing to". 
When it's done - everything goes to normal mode
