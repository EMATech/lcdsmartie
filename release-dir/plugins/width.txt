What does this thing do?
---

Unfortunately, despite LCD Smartie's wide array of input functions, it lacks
many basic formatting functions.  Though these are under development, I feel
that something needs to be done in the interim.  Hence, Width!

This plugin allows you to force a string to take up a specific width on the
screen, allowing you to properly align things and keep the screen from shifting
as string lengths change.  You can specify whether the string should be left or
right justified or centered within the width, whether a string larger than the
width should be truncated, and what character should be used to fill the empty
space.  Of all these, only the width is required; all others are optional.


How do I use it?
---

Usage: $dll(width.dll,1,format,input)

format can contain any of these elements, in any order:
    <width> - Must be a whole number (integer > 0), required.
    [l|r|c] - Specifies the alignment of the characters within the width.
              Also specifies what part of the string will be kept if truncated.
              Defaults to left ('l', lowercase L).
    [x]     - If present, strings which are longer than width will be truncated
              to fit.  In this case, the part kept will depend on the alignment
              specified above.
    [#?]    - ? is a single character which will be used to fill in any empty
              spaces.  Defaults to ' ' (a space).
              
Example: $dll(width.dll,1,4r,24%)
Returns: " 24%"

Example: $dll(width.dll,1,5c#-,Hi!)
Returns: "-Hi!-"

Example: $dll(width.dll,1,7c,oops)
Returns: " oops  " (notice that if sides are uneven, right is always larger)

Example: $dll(width.dll,1,16,not very long)
Returns: "not very long   "

Example: $dll(width.dll,1,10,not very long)
Returns: "not very long" (without x, expands to fit)

Example: $dll(width.dll,1,10x,not very long)
Returns: "not very l" (truncated, uses default left justification)
