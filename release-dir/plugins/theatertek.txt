Introduction

This is a plugin that makes it possible to display DVD player statistics from
Theatertek DVD player software.

Limitations

This plugin redefines the custom characters when using the play state graphic,
so no graphs can be displayed on the same screen.

Install

To install this plugin copy the theatertek.dll into the plugins directory of LCD
Smartie.  [Only the 5.3 and above builds are supported.]

The zip file also includes a config-theatertek.ini file which shows how the
plugin can be used - backup your config.ini file before renaming this as
config.ini.

Usage

To use the plugin you will need to insert commands into the your screens.

The command takes the following form: $dll(theatertek,function,param1,param2)

  Function 1:  first param = which value  second param = ignored

    value

       0 = File name
       1 = Title number
       2 = Chapter number
       3 = Play state (text)
       4 = Play speed
       5 = Aspect ratio
       6 = Audio channels
       7 = Audio format (text)
       8 = Audio bitrate (Kbps)
       9 = Video bitrate (Mbps)
      10 = Disk ID

  Function 2:  time on disc

    first param = which time  second param = format

       0 = Time
       1 = Time remaining
       2 = Total time

    format = hh:nn:ss

  Function 3: both params ignored

     play state using custom characters

  Function 4: both params ignored

     Theatertek run state, returns 1 if Theatertek is active, 0 if it 
     Theatertek is not active.

Examples:

    * $dll(theatertek,1,1,0)
    * $dll(theatertek,1,7,0)
    * $dll(theatertek,3,0,0)
    * $dll(theatertek,2,0,hh:nn:ss)   

Skipping the Theatertek screen when Theatertek is not running:

1) set the Theatertek screen no disabled by unchecking the enabled box.
2) add the following two functions to the actions screen:

   if $dll(theatertek.dll,4,0,0) = 1 enablescreen(1)
   if $dll(theatertek.dll,4,0,0) = 0 disablescreen(1) 

Change the screen number to the appropriate number for whatever screen
you are using.
