From wikipedia.org/wiki/LCD_Smartie
LCD Smartie is open-source software for Microsoft Windows which allows a character LCD to be used as an auxiliary display device for a PC.
Supported devices include displays based on the Hitachi HD44780 Controller, the Matrix Orbital Serial/USB LCD, and Palm OS devices (when used in conjunction with PalmOrb).
The program has built in support for many systems statistics (i.e. cpu load, network utilization, free disk space...), downloading RSS feeds, Winamp integration and support for several other popular applications.
To support less common applications LCD Smartie uses a powerful plugin system.

After having no updates for 10 years and very little activity on the lcd smartie forums I have decided that the original project has been abandoned by its developers.
I have therefore forked from the original project and have added some fixes and improvements.
While there is much information on the lcd smartie forums any issues with this fork should be reported here. It's high likely you wouldn't get a reply there anyway.
