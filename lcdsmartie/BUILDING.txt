This project can not be built by trial versions of Delphi Studio; trail versions do
not allow binary only components to be installed and will fail stating that they
can't find the xxxx.pas file.


This project requires the following components to be installed and in the projects path:
 - CoolTrayIcon from: http://subsimple.com/delphi.asp
 - Async32 from: http://www.tmssoftware.com/
 - WinampCtrl.


All of these components can be found in the components sub-directory.


Install all components before loading the LCD Smartie project.
