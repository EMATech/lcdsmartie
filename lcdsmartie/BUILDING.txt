Currently this project doesn't build; all references to WinAmp must be commented
out or changed over to use a new winamp component.


This project can not be built by trial versions of Delphi Studio; trail versions do
not allow binary only components to be installed and will fail stating that they
can't find the xxxx.pas file.


This project requires the following components to be installed and in the projects path:
 - CoolTrayIcon from: http://subsimple.com/delphi.asp
 - Async32 from: http://www.tmssoftware.com/
