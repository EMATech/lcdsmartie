Delphi Version
==============
This project is built using Delphi Version 7.

NB: This project can not be built by trial versions of Delphi Studio;
trail versions do not allow binary only components to be installed and
will fail stating that they can't find the xxxx.pas file.
[This restriction could be removed if we were to use different code for
handling the serial port.]

Required Components
===================
This project requires the following components to be installed and in
the projects path:
 - CoolTrayIcon from: http://subsimple.com/delphi.asp
 - Async32 from: http://www.tmssoftware.com/
 - WinampCtrl.

All of these components can be found in the components sub-directory.

Install all components before loading the LCD Smartie project.

Optional Software
=================
We also use madExcept (Optional), this is used for reporting errors
back to us from the user (also provides a great stack trace).
[This can also be found in the components sub-directory - or downloaded
from http://www.madexcept.com/]

Setting up the environment
==========================
Copy all the files (but not the CVS subdirectory!) from release-dir to the top
level directory - these are required for running the build.


---------------------------------------------------------------
Creating a release
==================
[This should be handled by a script or something - but is manual for the
moment]
- Copy the files (but not the subdirectories) from the images directory, into
  an images subdirectory of releases-dir.
- Copy the whole of the plugins directory into the release directory.
- Copy qstat.exe and dlportio.dll to the releases-dir.
- Copy a freshly built LCDSmartie.exe to the releases-dir.
- Update the README.txt.
- zip it all up.
