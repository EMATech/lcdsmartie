This plugin simply reads a text file from the internet and returns the text inside.
It will read the text file from the internet line by line inserting a CRLF between
each line. It will then return the entire text of the file to LCDSmartie.

Usage: 

$dll(webtxt,1,<url>,[refresh time in seconds]#[line number])

The refresh time in seconds defaults to 30. This is how often it will download the
text file from the web and display it. The minimum refresh time is 1 second.
