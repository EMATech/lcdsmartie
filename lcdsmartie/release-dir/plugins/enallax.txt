-----
The use of enallax of plugin is very simple.
You have to supply to text (or any other parameters) and chose the time.
e.g. $dll(enallax,5,TEXT 1,TEXT 2) where 5 is the seconds between screen changes.


   Examples

   $dll(enallax,1,$WinampPosition(20),$WinampLengts - $WinampResh)
   $dll(enallax,1,Cpu Speed: $CPUSpeed,Cpu  Temp: $Temp2)
   $dll(enallax,12,Cpu Usage: $CPUUsage%%,Cpu  Temp: $Temp2)






Function 20 returns dll information regardless of the parameters just add $dll(warnif.dll,20,param1,param2) 
and the credits screen will appear.

    NOTE:  in all functions is available a short description of returned string that can be displayed by passing the 
    "about" as param1 and "function" as param2.
    e.g. $dll(enallax.dll,1,about,function) or $dll(enallax.dll,10,about,function)
