Pre-alpha builds
================
These builds are believed to be stable but the developer(s) do not have access
to all supported LCD types and/or use all the features of LCD Smartie.

Increased error checking has been compiled in this build - so this build may
'fail' where the problem would have gone unnoticed in previous builds. By
reporting these bugs will increased LCD Smartie's stability.

BUGS KNOWN
==========
- Config changes not retained between releases; this is because Smartie
  currently stores settings in files rather than using the registry.

- Default screens are only for 4x40 screens (and not very good for 1x10
  LCDs).
