Delphi Version
==============
This project is built using Delphi Version 7.

NB: This project can not be built by trial versions of Delphi Studio;
trial versions do not allow binary only components to be installed and
will fail stating that they can't find the xxxx.pas file.
[This restriction could be removed if we were to use different code for
handling the serial port.]

Required Components
===================
This project requires the following components to be installed and in
the projects path:
 - CoolTrayIcon from: http://subsimple.com/delphi.asp
 - WinampCtrl.
 - Indy v10.5.1
 - indy SSL library
 - MadExcepts

All of these components can be found in the components sub-directory

Install all components before loading the LCD Smartie project.

Optional Software
=================
We also use madExcept (Optional), this is used for reporting errors
back to us from the user (also provides a great stack trace).
[This can also be found in the components sub-directory - or downloaded
from http://www.madexcept.com/]

Building
========
All delphi parts of the project can be built seperately using the corresponding .dpr file 
or all together at the same time by using the group project lcdsmartie.bpg
Built binaries are built into their proper places in the release-dir directory

Directory structure:
lcdsmartie	->
		->components ->3rd party stuff required to build
		->contrib ->3rd party plugin source
		->display_dll_source ->display dll source
		->DLL example ->demo.dll plugin source in a few different programming languages
		->DNBridge -> .net bridge dll source
		->graphics -> image files for the program to use internally
		->images -> skin images
		->release-dir -> after compiling, program and plugins can be found here. This whole folder would be zipped up for a release
        ->extras -> schematics, info, data sheets, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Creating a release
==================
[This should be handled by a script or something - but is manual for the
moment]
- Copy qstat.exe and dlportio.dll to the releases-dir.
- Update the README.txt.
- zip it all up.
